# Titanic Kaggle EDA

Welcome to my first GitHub project — an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.  
This project marks the beginning of my journey into Machine Learning by understanding and preparing data for model building.

---

## Objective

To explore, clean, and preprocess the Titanic dataset in preparation for building machine learning models.  
The focus is not just on analysis, but on making the dataset ML-ready.

---

## Files

- `titanic_eda.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook for the EDA and preprocessing steps.

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle – Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
- **Contains:** Passenger information such as age, sex, class, etc., used to predict survival.

---

## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.11
- Pandas
- NumPy

*More tools (like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn) to be added in later phases.*

---

## Work Done So Far

- Loaded and inspected `train.csv` and `test.csv`
- Checked for missing values
- Filled missing values in `Age` using the mean
- Combined train and test datasets temporarily for consistency
- Created new DataFrames to experiment with preprocessing

---

## What's Next

- Visualizations using Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Feature engineering (e.g., Title extraction, Cabin binning)
- Building basic ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluating model performance
